The sensor provides 4 channels for red, green, blue, and white light as well as an auto ranging feature. Power requirements are low, requiring only 1.6V to 3.3V to function with an operating current of 24 \u03bcA. The small form factor (2.1mm x 1.9mm x 0.6mm), low PPU ($2.88/Unit) and configurable I2C allow for multiple sensors to be implemented with ease if required.</p>"},{"location":"Component%20Selection/#voltage-regulator","title":"Voltage Regulator","text":"Manufacturer Part Number Image Pros Cons Analog Devices Inc.

The datasheet claims it is accurate within \u00b1 0.05V and has a possible energy efficiency of 90%.

This is done by measuring the amount of red, green, and blue light reflected off the surface of the marble to return 3 8-bit values to compare with an RGB sensor, and a white illuminator LED to ensure accurate measurements. Once these values have been found, they are sent to the actuator, HMI, and internet communication subsystem via UART. The sensor subsystem is required to run off of a 3.3V power supply under 500 mA.</p> <p>The Microchip PIC18F27Q84 is the best fit for the sensor subsystem. The chip is capable of operating at the designated 3.3 volts, and provides users with 1x I2C module as well as 5X UART modules. The sensor subsystem is relatively simple, and is only required to illuminate a ball on a track with a white LED and record R/G/B information in order to determine where the ball is sent. A single I2C module should be enough to control the TI OPT4060, and only one or two pins are required to control the LEDs. Multiple UART modules may be required to communicate with the HMI, sorting actuator, return actuator, and internet communication subsystems developed by the rest of team 201. The image below shows the selected I2C module, 3x UART modules, and 2x LED GPIO pins selected in the pin manager of the MCC Melody workspace.  </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"charts/","title":"Charts","text":"<pre><code>graph LR\n  A[Start] --&gt; B{Error?};\n  B --&gt;|Yes| C[Hmm...];\n  C --&gt; D[Debug];\n  D --&gt; B;\n  B ----&gt;|No| E[Yay!];</code></pre> <pre><code>sequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Alice-&gt;&gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\n  loop Healthcheck\n      John-&gt;&gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\n  end\n  Note right of John: Rational thoughts!\n  John--&gt;&gt;Alice: Great!\n  John-&gt;&gt;Bob: How about you?\n  Bob--&gt;&gt;John: Jolly good!</code></pre> <pre><code>stateDiagram-v2\n  state fork_state &lt;&lt;fork&gt;&gt;\n    [*] --&gt; fork_state\n    fork_state --&gt; State2\n    fork_state --&gt; State3\n\n    state join_state &lt;&lt;join&gt;&gt;\n    State2 --&gt; join_state\n    State3 --&gt; join_state\n    join_state --&gt; State4\n    State4 --&gt; [*]</code></pre>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.
